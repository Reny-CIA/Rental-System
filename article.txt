Jovic Park Rental Management System
by Peter Kiarie

Project: House Rental Management System using PHP/MySQLi
About
The Jovic Park Rental Management System is a complete PHP/MySQLi-based solution designed to streamline and simplify the operations of a house rental business. It manages house categories, property details, tenant information, and monthly payments — all in one central platform.

The system allows administrators to track which tenant occupies which house, the rental rate, outstanding balances, and any advance payments. Balances can be positive (amount owed) or negative (advance credit), and advance payments are automatically applied toward future rent.

With this system, management can quickly retrieve payment histories, monitor outstanding balances, and generate professional, printable reports.
